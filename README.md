# Fake Ruby

This repo contains a minimal and heavily commented reimplementation of the Ruby
memory management and garbage collector circa v2.7/3.0.

I'm building it as a learning resource that I can use alongside [The Garbage
Collection Handbook](http://gchandbook.org/) in order to explore some of the
material in the book.
